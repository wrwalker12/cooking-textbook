# Chapter 3: Meal Evaluation

Here is a chapter on meal evaluation.

## Why is meal evaluation important?

Meal evaluation helps you determine whether or not you want to add the meal you made to your repertoire. After you finish your meal, take some time to think about what you just ate. Here are some questions you can ask:

-   Did you like the meal?

-   Did your family like the meal?

-   Did your pet(s) end up eating it? Did they like it? (I was surprised once when my dog snubbed a piece of shrimp.)

-   What, specifically, did you or others not like? (The spicing, the texture, the mushrooms, the potatoes, the overall meal...? Identifying the specifics can help you decide if you want to try and tweak the recipe or just ditch it altogether.)

-   Did you enjoy making it?

-   Was the process worth the outcome? (Some meals are really complicated, and the final meal just isn't great. You might decide that the meal isn't worth the effort.)

-   Was the time spent cooking worth the outcome? (If it took a really long time and was just "OK", you might decide not to make it again.)

-   In general, would you want to make and eat that meal again?

You can consider all of these questions - and others that you'll ask given your circumstances - while you're eating, but my family prefers that I wait until after dinner to bring out the clipboard and survey questions. (I'm kidding, of course. I don't have a clipboard. I'm left-handed, and they're awkward to use.)

## Meal Evaluation Over Time

I could have amassed a large collection of recipes over the last ten years. The meal evaluation process helps me curate my recipe files so that I don't keep recipes that I know I'll never make again. It also helps me better understand likes and dislikes so that I can choose new recipes that are likely to make it into the regular rotation. Evaluating the meal can also help highlight areas of cooking strengths and areas that could use improvement. My vegetable chopping skills have definitely improved. Chopped pieces are more uniformly sized and therefore cook through more evenly. I'm not sure if I will ever understand how (or even why) to cook cube steak.

## Recipe Examples

And now for the part you might have expected all along: A couple of recipes. This book is, afterall, about cooking.

### Shopsky Salad

Shopsky salad is a delicious blend of fresh tomatoes, cucumber, green onion, and sour cream. (You could probably substitute plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream.) Add salt and pepper to taste, and you've got an easy, healthy, fast side dish to accompany whatever protein you choose to serve. It's a nice, light summer salad, but its green, red, and white colors can also add complement your Yuletime festivities.

### Crispy Pork Tacos

I love shredded pork, and I like my taco shells crispy! The pork takes time, and the taco shells cook one at a time, but I **love** tacos, so for me, the time is worth it.

*For the Pork*

1. Pre-heat the over to 325 degrees Fahrenheit, and place the oven rack in the lower third of the oven.
2. Place a 3-4 pound pork shoulder roast in a Dutch oven. (The roast can be boneless or bone-in.)
3. Generously season the roast all over with salt and pepper.
4. Add liquid to the pot until the roast is half-way submerged. The liquid can be water, chicken broth, or beef broth.
5. Place the Dutch oven on the stove over medium-high heat and bring the liquid to a simmer.
6. Once simmering, put a lid on the pot, and put the pot in the oven for 2-4 hours. 
7. When the pork is fork-tender and obviously shreddable, remove it to a cutting board and let it rest until it is cool enough to handle.
8. Using two forks or your fingers, shred the pork. 

*For the Taco Shells*

1. Heat about a cup of oil in a small skillet over medium-high heat. (I use grapeseed oil and a 7" skillet.)
2. Once the oil is heated, use tongs to place one corn tortilla into the skillet. Submerge one side then turn over to submerge the other side.
3. Using the tongs, fold the tortilla in half and fry in the oil for ten seconds or so. You want the tortilla to start taking the shape of a taco shell.
4. Turn the tortilla over again and use the tongs to hold one half of the tortilla at a 45 degree angle (out of the oil) so that as it cooks and hardens, it will be an easily fillable taco shell, not a closed one that you have to pry open (and crack) in order to fill with pork. Cook, holding up the tortilla edge 45 degrees out of the oil for about a minute, or until the half of the shell in the oil looks crispy and slighly brown.
5. Turn the shell over one last time and cook the remaining half until it looks crispy and slightly brown.
6. Remove the shell and place open-side down (to drain excess oil and help the shell maintain its taco shape) on a paper-towel lined plate or surface.
7. Repeat process with remaining tortillas. (This is all easier than it sounds.)

*Final Assembly*

1. Fill your crispy taco shells with some of the shredded pork.
2. Add whatever toppings you like: shredded lettuce, avocado, salsa, sour cream, onions, cilantro, cheese, etc.
