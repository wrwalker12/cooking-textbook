# Chapter 2: Meal Prepping

Here is a chapter on meal prepping.

## Why is meal prepping important?

Meal prepping helps make the actual cooking process easier. Meal prepping helps ensure that you have all of your ingredients out of the cupboards and on the counter, ready to use. Sometimes you can even measure out ingredients ahead of time so that when you start cooking, the ingredient is ready to be added. For example, you can measure out a cup of rice in the morning and leave it on the counter all day. Sometimes, managing cooking (or any number of other activities) is about managing in small increments at opportune moments.

Many experts will suggest that you prep your ingredients on a weekend or all at once at some other time. I don't usually have the time or all the necessary containers to do this, and some things are better prepped on the day you're planning to use them. If I'm home for lunch, I usually have time to cut up the bell pepper or even the broccoli that I'll use in the dinner meal that evening. I also usually have time to take out the skillet and the baking sheet that I'll need. When I come home from work, those one or two things are already done.

At this point, you might be asking why you can't just prep right before you start cooking. You can! Do what works for you. I highly recommend, however, that you at least know what ingredients you will need and where they are located in your kitchen so that you're not scrambling for that infrequently used spice that got jostled to the back of the cabinet while your garlic is burning.
