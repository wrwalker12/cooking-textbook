# Preface

This cooking textbook is a labor of love, motivated purely by my interest in learning and doing something new. I enjoy cooking, and this book attempts to deconstruct my cooking process and to approach the conventional cooking book in a non-conventional way. I hope it as odd for you to read as it was for me to conceive.
